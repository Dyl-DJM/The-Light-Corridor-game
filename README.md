# The Light Corridor

A 3D C/C++ project based on the "The Light Corridor" game. The purpose was to implement this game by using our skills in the computer graphics domain.

We mixed our 2D and 3D knowledge to build a nice game and make the user feel comfortable with the visual aspect of the game and its GUI.



This work was done in partnership by two computer sciences students.






## Requirements

To make this project run, OpenGL must be installed.
## Installation

### A - Compilation

To compile this project, you must be located at the root of the project and apply one of the following commands :


```bash
make         # Compile the playable module

make test    # Compile the test module (dev part)
```

### B - Execution

Once the project being compiled there is a bin directory created where we can find the executables :

=> **tlc**  (allows the user to launch the game)

=> **test** (launches the test module (dev part))

At the root you can write this : 

```bash
./bin/tlc   # Launches the game

./bin/test  # Launches the test module
```

Or being place in the bin directory : 

```bash
./tlc

./test 
```

    
## Usage

The user can use the left mouse button to make the racket going forward (if there isn't any obstacle), the right mouse button to launch the ball.

He can move the racket with its cursor movements in the screen.

To catch a bonus or make the ball bounce on it, he must put the racket to make the bonus/ball be in contact with it.







## Optimizations

Creating a new version with more intricate shapes and enhanced textures could be an interesting direction to take this project in.
